# 🪙 Blockchain Network (Python + Flask)

A simple **Proof-of-Work blockchain** built with **Python and Flask**, featuring block mining, transaction recording, node registration, and synchronization across multiple nodes.  
Developed as part of a university project on blockchain and distributed ledger technology.

---

## 🚀 Overview
This project simulates a decentralized blockchain network that allows users to:
- Add and broadcast transactions between nodes
- Mine new blocks using a Proof-of-Work algorithm
- Synchronize and validate chains across different nodes  
- Demonstrate how consensus and immutability are achieved in distributed systems

It was created as part of the **Blockchain module at La Trobe University** to explore the fundamentals of blockchain technology, including hashing, proof-of-work, and consensus mechanisms.

## ✨ Features
✅ Proof-of-Work algorithm with adjustable difficulty target  
✅ RESTful API for block, transaction, and node management  
✅ Genesis block auto-generation  
✅ Chain validation and consensus mechanism (longest chain wins)  
✅ Multi-node simulation for distributed behavior
